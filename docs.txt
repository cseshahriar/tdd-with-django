Functional test
    Deal with the way a user will interact with your project, also knows as functionality.

    Example
        - if the user goes to your homepage, they will see the restaurant's logo
        - if the use goes to the order page, they will be able to order a pizza
        - if the user wants to change their order, they change

Unit tests
    Ensure that small pieces of your project are working as they should.

    Example
        - The ability to create a Pizza object from the Pizza class
        - The function pizza_description() will appropriately tell  the size 
            and toppings of a pizza
        - A specific URL loads a specific view


Differences

        - Ensure pizza_description() is working properly
